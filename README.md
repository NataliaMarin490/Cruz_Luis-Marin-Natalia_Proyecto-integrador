# Integrated Project - Dental Clinic

This is an integrated project for managing a dental clinic. The system allows the management of patients, dentists, addresses and appointments, with a backend developed in Java and a simple frontend using JavaScript.

## Project Description

The dental clinic management system is designed to facilitate the administration of appointments and the information of both patients and dentists. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend**: Developed in Java, it handles all operations related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) clinic data. Spring Boot was used to build a REST API that communicates with the frontend via HTTP requests.

- **Frontend**: A simple interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with the system by filling out forms to add or modify information about patients, dentists, and appointments.

## Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Allows registering, updating, deleting, and viewing patient information.
- **Dentist Management**: Allows registering, updating, deleting, and viewing dentist information.
- **Addresses Management**: Allows registering and modifying addresses to patients.
- **Appointment Management**: Allows assigning, modifying, and canceling appointments between patients and dentists.
